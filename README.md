# Note Taker
## Description

This project is aimed to build a note taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

## User Story

I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

```

GIVEN a note-taking application
WHEN I open the Note Taker
THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
